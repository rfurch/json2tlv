# Example Makefile for ArcEngine C++ Programming on Linux

#
# The PROGRAM macro defines the name of the program or project.  It
# allows the program name to be changed by editing in only one
# location
#

PROGRAM = json2tlv

#
# Command line parameters: Edit these parameters so that you can
# easily run the sample by typing "make -f Makefile.Linux run".
#
# You will need to:
# (1) Describe parameters here. ex: IN_SHAPEFILE is the input shapefile
# (2) Define parameters below this comment box.
#       ex: IN_SHAPEFILE = /mycomp/data/shapefile.shp
# (3) Add the parameters to the run target at the end of this file
#       ex: ./$(PROGRAM) $(IN_SHAPEFILE)
#

#
# The INCLUDEDIRS macro contains a list of include directories
# to pass to the compiler so it can find necessary header files.
#
# The LIBDIRS macro contains a list of library directories
# to pass to the linker so it can find necessary libraries.
#
# The LIBS macro contains a list of libraries that the the
# executable must be linked against.

#
# The CXXSOURCES macro contains a list of source files.
#
# The CXXOBJECTS macro converts the CXXSOURCES macro into a list
# of object files.
#
# The CXXFLAGS macro contains a list of options to be passed to
# the compiler.  Adding "-g" to this line will cause the compiler
# to add debugging information to the executable.
#
# The CXX macro defines the C++ compiler.
#
# The LDFLAGS macro contains all of the library and library
# directory information to be passed to the linker.

# Run target: "make -f Makefile.Linux run" to execute the application
